                <br>I've been away from my site for some time now.  The reason for that is 
                I've recently begun an intensive technical bootcamp called Tech Elevator.  Their 
                mission is to jumpstart there students into a programming or programming related job. Preparing for and initially starting this 
                program was cutting into my website time.
                <br>
                Tech Elevator has really highlighted how beneficial side projects are for practice and for bolstering one's portfolio so I 
                am now looking to not only continuing with this site and Project Iron but with several smaller sized projects which I will 
                detail in the new Side Projects section.  This section was added as a way a means to log my thoughts so that I have an excuse to 
                update this site on a more frequent basis.  I look forward to fleshing this place out.
